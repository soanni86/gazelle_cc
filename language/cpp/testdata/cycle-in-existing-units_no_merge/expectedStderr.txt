gazelle: Existing cc_library rules [a1 a2] defined in %WORKSPACEPATH%/BUILD.bazel form a cyclic dependency. Possible resolutions:
  - Set `# gazelle:cc_group_unit_cycles merge` to automatically merge targets to avoid cyclic dependencies.
  - Manually combine targets to avoid cyclic dependencies.
  - Remove `#include`s from source files that cause cyclic dependencies: [a1.h a2.h]
